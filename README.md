This is an OpenKH mod that randomizes the music in the PC port of Kingdom Hearts (1). You'll need the [OpenKH Tools](https://github.com/OpenKH/OpenKh/releases) to use this mod.

To install the mod, you can either download the repository as a zip (the green 'Code' button) or add `MainMemory/KH1PCMusicRando` as a mod in the OpenKH Mod Manager, then run the included EXE file to set up the randomization.

This mod is designed to be compatible with the KH2 randomizer's built-in music support, the File menu has options to select the extracted game folder and custom music folder. If you don't set a custom music folder the tool looks in its own folder for music.

You can create subfolders named `field`, `battle`, `boss`, `cutscene`, and `wild`, and put `.scd` files in those folders based on where you want them to appear, you can also edit `musiclist.json` if you want to change the categories that songs use.

Source code for the program is available [here](https://github.com/MainMemory/KH1PCMusicRando-src) for anyone curious.
